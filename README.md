# MoonPhase
by Shawn Wilson and Ryan Wilson
This code gets run on a Raspberry Pi, connected to 6 LEDs within a moon night light.  We hacked an existing night light, but you could 3D print a moon night light and add LEDs (or print a flat moon graphic and backlight it).   It will illuminate the night light to mimic the moon's actual phase, or light up just the center of the moon's face to indicate an error.

This hasn't been tested in a live Pi Zero yet.
